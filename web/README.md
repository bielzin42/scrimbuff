# Scrimbuff Web Client

## Installation guide

Follow this guide to be able to run scrimbuff's web client on your machine.

### For development:

We only use one environment variables, which is the `API URL`. Copy `.env.example` and provide the url.

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

```conf
REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3333
```
Run `$ yarn start` to start the development server. The Web default port is `3000`.

### For deployment

You must provide the same environment variables as you would in development mode.

After that, run:

```bash
$ yarn build
```

After that, a `/build` folder will be generated by `create-react-app`. Use this folder to host the website.

### Hints

Its possible to serve the web client with the npm package `serve`.

We use NginX in our production server.
