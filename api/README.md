# Scrimbuff REST API


## Installation guide

Follow this guide to be able to install scrimbuff's api on your machine.

You must have a database up and running. We mainly use PostgreSQL.

### For development:

Provide the necessary environment variables:

```confg
TYPEORM_CONNECTION =
TYPEORM_HOST =
TYPEORM_PORT =
TYPEORM_USERNAME =
TYPEORM_PASSWORD =
TYPEORM_DATABASE =
TYPEORM_LOGGING =
TYPEORM_ENTITIES = ./src/models/*.ts
TYPEORM_ENTITIES_DIR = ./src/models/
TYPEORM_MIGRATIONS = ./src/database/migrations/*.ts
TYPEORM_MIGRATIONS_DIR = ./src/database/migrations
```

Run `$ yarn dev` to start the development server. The API default port is `3333`.

### For deployment

You must provide the same environment variables as you would in development mode but we need to repeat the same procedure to deployment mode inside `/dist` folder.

```bash
$ yarn build
```

After that, a `/dist` folder will be generated by `typescript`. Copy the `.prod.env.example` file put it inside the `/dist` folder.

```bash
$ cp .prod.env.example dist/.env
```
